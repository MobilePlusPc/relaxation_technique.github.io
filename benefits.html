                    <p>According to a study in 2017, Finding relaxation by watching a movie might be a good idea to eliminate unnecessary distractions during the movie.
                         If you have trouble disconnecting from work or study, consider leaving your phone and other devices in another room or on “do not disturb” mode so that you’re interrupted only for urgent matters.
                         You might find that you’re able to engage your mind with the plot you’re following without distractions, which could make for a more soothing experience.
                         A musical or romantic comedy, could be just the distraction you need to relax after a long day.
